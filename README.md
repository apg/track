# Eye Track: A stopwatching.us thingy for Hack and Tell.

This is stupidly hacky, and utilizes some example code from
stackoverflow to do [motion detection](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3374828/how-do-i-track-motion-using-opencv-in-python),
and some pygame stuff to draw it all. It's got bugs, don't worry about
it. No one cares.

Requires: pyopencv, pygame
